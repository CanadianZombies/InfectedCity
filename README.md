# InfectedCity
InfectedCity is a new ground up 'simple' MUD engine.


The following are what we intend for the basic engine design.

* Accounts
* Character creation
* Basic command support
* Bacic Online Creation support
* World Structure
* Basic Skill framework

Once the above are completed we will be release do our first complete release on Mudbytes.net.
From there we will continue to expand support and features.
